#### General Guidelines
  * Clone this project to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Pabarreyro/index-pdx.git`
  * Assign yourself an issue issueName from our repo
  * Make a new local branch and start to work on it: `git checkout -b issueName`
  * It is great practice to follow [this commit style](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

#### Open A New Issue
  * If you’d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure
  the issues you are reporting do  not replicate the existing issues.
  * If you’ve determined that this issue doesn’t exist anywhere else. Use the [issue template](https://github.com/Pabarreyro/index-pdx/issues/new) to open a new issue.
  * Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible.

#### Make A Pull Request
  * When sending a PR have an appropriate title referencing the issue which it solves.
  Add “fixes #” in the commit body, so that when the PR gets merged, the issue gets closed automatically. Do not do this if the PR solves only a part of the issue.
